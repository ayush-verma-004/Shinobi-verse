                <h2>About Chidori</h2>
                <p>The Chidori is an advanced lightning-based jutsu created by Kakashi Hatake. It channels concentrated lightning chakra into the user's hand, producing a high-speed thrust capable of piercing targets. It’s known for its chirping sound and blinding speed. While powerful, it requires the Sharingan for accurate use due to its speed. Sasuke Uchiha later developed variants like Chidori Stream and Chidori Senbon for greater versatility.</p>

                <h2>About Sasuke's Life</h2>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki emerged as an underdog from the Hidden Leaf, recognized for his loud spirit, boundless determination, and unshakable will. Once shunned by many for housing the Nine-Tails, he endured isolation to prove his worth and protect his home. He trained relentlessly, facing countless foes, always driven by his promise to save his friend Sasuke. Deep down, Naruto was a hopeful dreamer who gave his all for unity and the bonds he cherished most</p>
