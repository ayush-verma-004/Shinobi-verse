                    <h2>Kakashi Sharingan</h2>
                    <p>Kakashi received his Sharingan from Obito Uchiha during a mission as a gift. Though not an Uchiha, he could use it with great skill, mastering powerful techniques like Kamui. The Sharingan enhanced his perception and made Chidori usable. He lost it after the war when Obito's chakra faded.</p>

                    <h2>Kakashi Susanoo</h2>
                    <p>Kakashi awakened the Perfect Susanoo temporarily during the Fourth Great Ninja War after receiving both of Obito's Mangeky≈ç Sharingan. His Susanoo is uniquely powerful, with kamui abilities that let it phase through attacks and create dimensional portals. It wields chakra sabers and even flies, making it one of the strongest versions seen. This power vanished after Obito's spirit passed on.</p>

                    <h2>Kakashi Chidori</h2>
                    <p>Kakashi's Chidori, also called Lightning Blade (Raikiri), is a powerful lightning-style jutsu he created. It channels intense lightning chakra into his hand, producing a high-speed thrust attack. He could only master it after gaining the Sharingan, which helped him counter its speed. It's famous for its piercing power and signature chirping sound</p>
