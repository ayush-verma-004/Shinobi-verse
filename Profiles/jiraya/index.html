                    <h2>About Jiraiya's Sage Mode</h2>
                    <p>Jiraiya's Sage Mode is a powerful transformation <br> that grants him enhanced strength, speed, and <br> sensory abilities by balancing natural energy with <br> his chakra. In this state, his appearance changes <br> with toad-like features including warts and <br> elongated nose. While imperfect compared to <br> Naruto's later mastery, Jiraiya's Sage Mode allows <br> him to perform devastating techniques like the <br> Massive Rasengan and powerful toad summonings.</p>
